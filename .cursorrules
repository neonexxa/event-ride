# Carpool System Project Rules

## Seeding Script
- All seed data files in `dummy-data/` must follow pattern: `{number}_{collection}.json`
- Files are processed in numerical order
- Do NOT modify `seed-firestore.js` when adding new collections
- Just add new JSON files with proper naming

## Firestore Collections
- Events: Uses custom document IDs (from 'id' field in data)
- Cars: Uses auto-generated IDs
- Always include event_id in cars to reference events

## File Structure
- React app files: `/src`
- Seed data: `/dummy-data`
- Deployment config: `/app.yaml`
- Service account key: `/SA.json` (gitignored)
